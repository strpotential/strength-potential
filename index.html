                        <p class="text-white mb-4">Mitt navn er Jonatan Dam. Jeg tar en BSc i fysioterapi, og er sertifisert personlig trener gjennom Strength System Online Certification, level 1 og 2.
                            Trening er noe som har en spesiell plass i hjertet mitt. Når jeg var 12 år gammel, ble jeg diagnotisert med kronisk utmattelsessyndrom. Jeg hadde redusert funksjon i dagliglivet i over 5 år, og vet hvordan det føles å være på bunnen. 
                            Dette gir meg ekstra verdsettelse for hvordan man kan bygge kroppen- og sinnet opp igjen.
                            <br><br>
                            Denne erfaringen har vært drivkraften bak karrieren min som personlig trener. 
                            Jeg drar nytte av erfaringer fra flere år som personlig trener, samt erfaringer som trener- og spiller for Sandnes Øst Rugbyklubb, som konkurrerer på nasjonal basis.
                            Disse erfaringene lar meg hjelpe deg å oppnå ditt fulle potensiale, enten du aldri har rørt en vekt, eller har trent i flere år.

                                            I had been working out for 6 years prior to meeting Jonatan, my work capacity was amazing but I had reached a plateau
                                            that I just couldn't fight through. That's when Jonatan offered to look over my training and now, two years later I
                                            couldn't be more satisfied with the help I've gotten. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Jonatan is by far the most knowledgeable trainer I've had the
                                            honor of training with, he is extremely friendly, encouraging and gives you the motivation needed for you to
                                            continuously develop and build a better physique. He has corrected my form and taught me how to get the most out of my
                                            training, but most importantly he makes training fun and exciting. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I would highly recommend Jonatan for anyone looking
                                            for a great workout regardless of fitness level.

                                            to realize that I had gotten the most I could out of it. Starting at S&C with Jonatan as my coach really changed things
                                            for me.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I wanted to join the military and was afraid that I would not be able to meet the admission requirements. In order to
                                            develop both strength and endurance, I joined my friend for a test-session at S&C, and I never looked back. After
                                            training at S&C for a while, Jonatan started as a coach there. In many ways, that was the best thing that ever happened
                                            to my training in terms of progression. After getting to know my current limitations, Jonatan wrote a program for me.
                                            Thanks to that, both my strength and motivation reach a new level.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In the beginning I was afraid of not being strong enough, not being able to meet the expectations or not being able to
                                            do certain exercises that he would give me. I soon found out that this was unnecessary to worry about. Jonatan is really
                                            down to earth, and has a truly comfortable charisma. Somehow, even if I was unhappy with my own performance, he made me
                                            feel successful.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            During my time training with Jonatan, I have had a fast progression and have become much stronger in various ways over a
                                            relatively short period of time. In addition to being my coach, Jonatan has also become my friend. This has increased
                                            the joy of training, and made the hard work more fun. If you want someone to push you, and expand your limits, whilst
                                            being patient, respectful and aware of your conditions and ambitions, I would recommend Jonatan as a coach. He has a
                                            wide base of knowledge, and a drive to help people get the most out of their training.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            PS: The admission requirements in the military were a piece of cake following Jonatan’s coaching.

                                            Jonatan har vært trener for meg de siste tre årene. Jeg jobbet med å komme tilbake etter en skade i begge skuldrene, som
                                            skapte store problemer i forhold til det vanlige treningsprogrammet mitt.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Jeg var lenge redd for at jeg måtte gi opp styrketreningen, siden skuldrene var så lite bevegelige, og tålte ikke
                                            belastning. Jonatan klarte imidlertid å tilpasse øvelser og en gradvis opptrapping av øvelser slik at jeg kom helt
                                            tilbake, og faktisk er sterkere i overkropp og skuldre enn jeg var før skaden.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Han var kreativ og tålmodig, og klarte også å få meg motivert for å jobbe med den langvarige opptreningen.
                                        </p>

                                            I've worked as a personal trainer for five years, and feel I'm pretty knowledgeable. I talked a lot with Jonatan, and
                                            quickly understood how insightful he was in regards to strength training. I let him coach me, and quickly understood how
                                            far behind I actually was education-wise.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In an informal, respectful, and fun way he shared what he knew, and I ended up being a better trainer and got stronger.
                                            I learned how important programming is, and how many different ways there are of doing it. Jonatan is the kind of guy
                                            who speaks his mind, with no fear of being wrong. If your attitude around training is weak, he'll tell you, but not in a
                                            mean way. He'll help you gain perspective and train you in how to think to enjoy the training mentally, which leads to
                                            you growing physically.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I've seen him inspire people in all walks of life, me included. He's stern, but kind, and will always listen if you try
                                            to bail on an exercise, just make sure it's a legitimate excuse. He cares for his clients, and about their goals.
                                            Handing the reigns over to Jonatan, will let you turn your mind off, and simply follow his directions.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I've always believed in brutal honestly when it comes to training, and I've seen the glorious results it bears. Jonatan
                                            seems to agree, and has helped a lot of people dig themselves out of deep tunnels and build better lives. This is a
                                            quality trainer, who really knows what he's doing. Don't let this offer pass, it's unlikely you'll find a better one.

                                        <p>
                                            I've worked as a personal trainer for five years, and feel I'm pretty knowledgeable. I talked a lot with
                                            Jonatan, and
                                            quickly understood how insightful he was in regards to strength training. I let him coach me, and
                                            quickly understood how
                                            far behind I actually was education-wise.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In an informal, respectful, and fun way he shared what he knew, and I ended up being a better trainer
                                            and got stronger.
                                            I learned how important programming is, and how many different ways there are of doing it. Jonatan is
                                            the kind of guy
                                            who speaks his mind, with no fear of being wrong. If your attitude around training is weak, he'll tell
                                            you, but not in a
                                            mean way. He'll help you gain perspective and train you in how to think to enjoy the training mentally,
                                            which leads to
                                            you growing physically.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I've seen him inspire people in all walks of life, me included. He's stern, but kind, and will always
                                            listen if you try
                                            to bail on an exercise, just make sure it's a legitimate excuse. He cares for his clients, and about
                                            their goals.
                                            Handing the reigns over to Jonatan, will let you turn your mind off, and simply follow his directions.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I've always believed in brutal honestly when it comes to training, and I've seen the glorious results it
                                            bears. Jonatan
                                            seems to agree, and has helped a lot of people dig themselves out of deep tunnels and build better
                                            lives. This is a
                                            quality trainer, who really knows what he's doing. Don't let this offer pass, it's unlikely you'll find
                                            a better one.
